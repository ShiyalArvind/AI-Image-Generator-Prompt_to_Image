# image

This feature allows users to provide an existing photo as input, which is then sent to a backend API to generate a new AI-enhanced or AI-stylized image based on that photo. Optionally, users can also enter a text prompt to guide the transformation â€” allowing the system to combine visual input with creative direction, such as modifying style, theme, or artistic effects.
